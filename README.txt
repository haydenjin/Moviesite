## About The Project

This website was created for a class assignment. In order to build the site, I had to use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, and AJAX. Some features of the site includes features such as user logins and profiles, a database a movies, and the ability to create watchlists and rate movies. 

Overall, I found this project to be very helpful to my development as a future software engineer. I learned about different aspects and technologies of the web, how JavaScript interacts with the base layer of a website, and the basics of a SQL based database.
